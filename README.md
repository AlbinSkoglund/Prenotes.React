Prenotes React
============== 
The [Prenotes](swedishconnection.github.io/Prenotes/) client for browsers is written in React and bundled with Rollup.  This is the default implementation that gladly can be forked, rewritten (i.e. maybe Elm) or totally revamped.  We picked certain technologies that where mainstream at the tail of 2016.  This was done to assist high school kids in writing code for this part of the Prenotes project.  We wanted to have vanilla JavaScript (i.e. no TypeScript, Flow) and minimalistic frameworks like [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/), [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) and [Derivable](https://github.com/ds300/derivablejs).  Our hope is that the style of programming on the client is something that high schoolers can handle during an internship spanning over a month.

#Mimicing Twitter's design#
The client mimics the design for Twitter where notifications between daycare staff and caretakers are shown as an infinate list.
